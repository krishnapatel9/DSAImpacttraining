STRINGS
-->Strings are classes and arrays are objects .
-->A sequence of characters is called strings.
-->Strings are immutable.
-->All the array objects will be created in heap memory but strings are created inside heap memory in "string pool".
-->Once a string is created it will be created it will be created permanently it means we can't modify the string .


Example:
	String a = "Hello";
        String b = "Hello";
	System.out.print(a == b); // prints true as both a and b are pointing on same location of the data which is stored in heap memory.
But ,

	String a = new String("Hello");
        String b = new String("Hello");
	System.out.print(a == b); // prints false because both are different objects pointing on different locations.
 
- " == " is used to compare address allocations. And equals() method is used to compare data not the address.
 	eg.  
		System.out.print(a.equals(b));  // prints true in both of the above case as it compares the data.

Q. Reverse an array of integers.
To get array length we have to use "arr.length".For string's length we use "str.length()". In arr, length is field but in strings the length() is a method which returns a number of character.

Q. Convert a string to an array and then do reverse.


SUBSET - For a given array ,we have to print all possible arrays which should be in a sequence but not continuous. Thats called subset and in an array if we have n number of elements we will get 2^n subsets.

BACKTRACKING- It is an example of recursion
 - In recursion we have only two possibilities either " if " or "else"  and in backtracking we have multiple possibilities .
 - Most of the problems whenever we reach basecase, we have to print all the base case elements .
 - Remove last element in every recursive call.
